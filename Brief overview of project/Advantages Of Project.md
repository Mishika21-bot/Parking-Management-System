-	There is a greater sense of security due to the fact that patrons do not actually walk to and from their own space.
-	It is highly feasible for extremely small sites that are unable to accommodate a conventional ramped parking structure.
-	There is high parking efficiency (i.e. sf/space and cf/space).
-	There is no need for driving while looking for an available space.
-	Emissions are greatly brought down and reduced.
-	The patrons wait for their car in a highly controlled environment.
-	There are less chances for vehicle vandalism.
- There is a minimal staff requirement if it is used by known parkers.
-	It is possible that the retrieval time is lower than the combined driving/parking/walking time in conventional ramped parking structures.
- There is an easier facade integration since there are no ramping floors or openings in exterior walls.
